Today, I went for a walk. I couldn’t go for\na run because I still suffer from sore muscles from the day before yesterday. I\npicked up running again after a long time. It’s a quite apocalyptic atmosphere\nhere in Munich. There are almost no people on the streets since we are still in\nlockdown because of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>So like a lot of others, I work from home. I’m very grateful that my current\nmain activities require just a computer and internet connection. That allows me\nto admit that I for myself kind of like the situation because I can focus on my\ntasks without external distractions.</p>\n<p>I currently work on a project that requires mobile development (I really enjoy\nFlutter) and on some other projects which I don’t know yet how they will unfold.</p>\n<p>One of the main tasks I always pushed back and now has finally got some\nattention is the re-organization of my workflows with Emacs and Org mode. At the\nsame time, I take the quiet times and the lockdown as an oppurtunity to review\nmy long-term goals, my areas of interest and how to ensure that I’m executing on\nactionable tasks as much as possible.</p>\n<p>I need to break down my article topics into smaller chunks. Otherwise, I’m\noverwhelmed by the task at hand to write a huge article like the one I started 4\nweeks ago.</p>\n<p>I will write articles like the current one to prevent gaps that get too long\nbetween two article posts, but I also want to publish more (short) articles\ndocumenting how I do things regarding my workflow and my “tools” like my\nThinkpads, Linux, Emacs etc.</p>"}
