Another creed is to keep everything as minimal as possible, so it’s a goal to keep my arch installation as clean as possible on the least number of packages necessary. As always, everything within reasonable limits regarding time and effort.</p>\n<p>A daily <code class=\"language-text\">yay -Syu</code> is easy and quick. It allows me to actually read all the package names and rather often, some of the things below happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A certain package stirs some interest and I lookup the package name and learn what it does</li>\n<li>Over time, I get a feeling what packages are maintained or developed actively</li>\n<li>I’m more aware of why an error might have occurred because I saw a related package been updated recently</li>\n<li>It allows me to pinpoint a problem easier because not that many packages are updated when done on a daily basis</li>\n<li>I detect packages that I don’t use anymore and can uninstall them</li>\n</ul>"}
