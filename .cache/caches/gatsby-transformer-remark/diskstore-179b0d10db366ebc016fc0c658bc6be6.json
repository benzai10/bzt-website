So far, I have <code class=\"language-text\">flutter</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">android-studio</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">dropbox</code> here.</p>\n<h2>Permission Denied</h2>\n<p>In some situations like trying to update the Flutter SDK with <code class=\"language-text\">flutter upgrade</code>, I got a permission denied error. Usually, I repeat the command with <code class=\"language-text\">sudo !!</code> (the double exclamation mark appends the previous entered command to sudo), but in the case of the Flutter upgrade, it will not allow it or at least advise against it.</p>\n<h2>Set User Permission Rights to Folders</h2>\n<p>My solution to this issue (maybe there are better solutions) for the moment is setting permission rights for the current user I’m logged in with for these folders:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">sudo chown -R $USER /opt/flutter</code></p>"}
