Good old times with spending\nhours tweaking <code class=\"language-text\">config.sys</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">autoexec.bat</code> just to make a new game work.\nAfter that, glorious Windows 3.1, Windows 95, working professionally with\nWindows NT/Windows Server.</p>\n<p>In 2008 I had some software fatigue on Windows, I just wanted a computer that\nworks, a device that has all the software I need and is a good piece of hardware. The new\naluminum unibody Macbook was delivering all of that for me and it stood its\nground until 2017.</p>\n<p>After almost 10 years and the recently ridiculous pricing politics by Apple—a new\ncharger cost me once more than 100 US dollars in Korea—and their trend to make\ntheir hardware less and less expandable and fixable, I decided to look for\nalternatives.</p>\n<p>I already installed Linux for robotics-related development with\n<a href=\"https://www.ros.org/\">ROS</a>. Step-by-step, I started my way out of the Apple\necosystem. Later in that year, half of the display backlight on my Macbook went\ndark, so it was time to find a new laptop.</p>\n<p>I researched on the Internet and found out that Lenovo Thinkpads, even or in\nparticular, older models were a great match to use with Linux. Living in Seoul,\nSouth Korea, I headed to the Yongsan Electronics Market and in one of its\nbellies, at a second-hand laptop shop, I found a Thinkpad T420 in mint condition\nfor an affordable 220 US dollars. For an extra 120 dollars I bought a 256GB\nmSATA disk for the system install.</p>\n<p>The performance improvement over the old Macbook was incredible and I was\nhooked.</p>"}
