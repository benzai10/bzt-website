But as soon I was in select mode, I\nwas not able to change the pages anymore.</p>\n<p>Realizing that I now would need to research and patch my st\ninstallation for such a basic functionality and knowing that this\nfeature comes out of the box with other terminal emulations, I\nreverted back to termite.</p>\n<p>Scrollback and selecting/copying text works without any hiccups.\nThere’s one thing though I need to fix (later): Somehow, dwm shows\n“broken” as a window title for termite.</p>\n<h2>Update: Fix missing window title</h2>\n<p>The utility <code class=\"language-text\">xprop</code> showed me that the <code class=\"language-text\">WM_NAME</code> is empty when I open\na <code class=\"language-text\">termite</code> window on my computer. <code class=\"language-text\">termite --title=&quot;termite&quot;</code> opens\nthe terminal with the specified title, so I just had to change this in\nthe <code class=\"language-text\">dwm</code> config file and after compiling <code class=\"language-text\">dwm</code> I now have a proper\nwindow title.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">static const char *termcmd[]  = { &quot;termite&quot;, &quot;--title=termite&quot; };</code></p>"}
