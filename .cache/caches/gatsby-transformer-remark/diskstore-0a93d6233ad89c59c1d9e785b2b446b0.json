I’m using the GRUB bootloader which allows to have a default setting and multiple (as desired) boot options. I had two to three encounters when after updating my packages, Arch wouldn’t reboot properly or there were issues in some applications.</p>\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Display was full of artifacts after starting the window manager (dwm)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the culprit which was the intel-vulkan driver</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>External monitor not working anymore with dwm</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently using the LTS kernel and hoping the problem will be resolved with the next kernel update</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s good to know, that even if something breaks after a package update, there’s an immediate easy way to “roll back” to a kernel that at least works properly until the issue with the new kernel is resolved.</p>"}
