Everything worked the same\nlike on the T420. The only drawbacks were the lack of USB 3 and\nsometimes I wished I had a little bit a quicker processor and more RAM\nbecause some of the development tools were a little bit laggy.</p>\n<p>In 2018, I went to a tech conference in Hong Kong with my startup at\nthat time and I brought both\nof my Thinkpads with me to be safe and have enough support to setup,\nrun and maybe debug the robot prototypes we brought with us for the\nconference. One week later, I left Hong Kong back to Seoul and I had\nfour Thinkpads in my luggage.</p>\n<p>In Hong Kong, I’ve heard about the New Golden Market, an area with a\nlot of second-hand computer shops and I couldn’t resist to purchase\ntwo Thinkpads in pristine condition—a X230 and a T430s. Both are\nequipped with 16 GB of RAM and 500 GB SSDs.</p>\n<p>To this date, they are my daily drivers, both running Arch Linux and\ndwm window manager and the only thing that is missing to perfection is\nan upgrade to IPS screen panels. I even don’t miss the old 7-row\nkeyboards, I’m happy with the new ones. As an Emacs user with default\nkey bindings, the keyboard layout is even better for me.</p>"}
