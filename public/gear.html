      <p>When I was moving from Switzerland to South Korea in 2009, I had only one suitcase containing all my belongings. Having lived in a very small apartment in the center of Seoul, it was very deliberating having not too much stuff.</p>
      <p>This has changed. I now live in Munich and during the pandemic, I picked up playing guitar again after having quit playing for more than 15 years.</p>
      <p>Having found some new passion, a lot of gear has arrived in my home studio.</p>
      <p>On this page, I would like to give an overview of the gear I own, I plan to purchase, maybe some reviews and tutorials might follow later as well. Let me know, if you're interested in such content.</p>
