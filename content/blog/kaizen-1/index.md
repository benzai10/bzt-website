[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) (改善) means "improvement", as a concept it's referring to continuous improvement of all functions.

I will use this kind of article format to write all kinds of content about how something helps me to improve in one of my areas of interest. Later, I might be able to compile collections of these for certain categories or summarize them in separate articles.

I will number them through with being this the first article in the series.
