Rolling Learning
---
One of the reasons I switched to Arch was to force myself to learn more about Linux. Another creed is to keep everything as minimal as possible, so it's a goal to keep my arch installation as clean as possible on the least number of packages necessary. As always, everything within reasonable limits regarding time and effort.

A daily `yay -Syu` is easy and quick. It allows me to actually read all the package names and rather often, some of the things below happen:

* A certain package stirs some interest and I lookup the package name and learn what it does
* Over time, I get a feeling what packages are maintained or developed actively
* I'm more aware of why an error might have occurred because I saw a related package been updated recently
* It allows me to pinpoint a problem easier because not that many packages are updated when done on a daily basis
* I detect packages that I don't use anymore and can uninstall them
