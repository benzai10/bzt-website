From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzaiten):
> Benzaiten (弁才天, 弁財天) (Benten for short) is a Japanese Buddhist goddess who originated from the Hindu goddess Saraswati. She is the goddess of everything that flows: water, time, words, speech, eloquence, music and by extension, knowledge.

I like this as a very rough mission statement of what I plan to share here. More specifically, the areas of interest are (in no particular order and subject to be changed):

* Documenting the evolution of this blog/website
* Covering (mainly) technology and programming topics
* Use it as a sharing platform and to interact with likeminded people
* Showcase different aspects of my work and maybe other parts of my life
* Ensure that the content generation keeps flowing
* Try to pick up making music (playing guitar) again


I use Benzai10 because the domain name Benzaiten was not available anymore.
