My Thinkpad addiction started with a T420 and since I was too lazy to
always carry the laptop between my apartment and the office I wanted
very soon a second one, which was a X220. Everything worked the same
like on the T420. The only drawbacks were the lack of USB 3 and
sometimes I wished I had a little bit a quicker processor and more RAM
because some of the development tools were a little bit laggy.

In 2018, I went to a tech conference in Hong Kong with my startup at
that time and I brought both
of my Thinkpads with me to be safe and have enough support to setup,
run and maybe debug the robot prototypes we brought with us for the
conference. One week later, I left Hong Kong back to Seoul and I had
four Thinkpads in my luggage.

In Hong Kong, I've heard about the New Golden Market, an area with a
lot of second-hand computer shops and I couldn't resist to purchase
two Thinkpads in pristine condition--a X230 and a T430s. Both are
equipped with 16 GB of RAM and 500 GB SSDs.

To this date, they are my daily drivers, both running Arch Linux and
dwm window manager and the only thing that is missing to perfection is
an upgrade to IPS screen panels. I even don't miss the old 7-row
keyboards, I'm happy with the new ones. As an Emacs user with default
key bindings, the keyboard layout is even better for me.
